# Sprint 32 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 9
- Sprint: Sprint 32
- Status: Planned
- Primary Architecture Layers: Reporting / Compliance

## Architectural Intent

Complete user and developer documentation for operational, security, and integration workflows.

## Implementation Detail

Planned deliverables include finalized operator guides, developer integration references, QA evidence traceability, and governance documentation updates.

## Security and Control Posture

- AAA scope and authorization boundaries are enforced according to current orchestrator policy.
- Telemetry and audit events are expected to remain structured, attributable, and export-ready.
- Integration interfaces are maintained as loosely coupled contracts to preserve VectorVue interoperability.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Documentation QA includes link integrity, policy alignment, and release-readiness checks.

## Risk Register

Risk is documentation drift from codebase; mitigation via docs QA automation and review gates.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 33 prepares release packaging.
