# Sprint 1 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 1
- Sprint: Sprint 1
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Orchestration Pipeline, Reporting / Compliance

## Architectural Intent

Establish a deterministic engineering baseline with reproducible local development, CI hooks, and operational hygiene controls.

## Implementation Detail

Repository skeleton, Python environment strategy, containerized developer runtime, IDE defaults, pre-commit controls, and AAA/logging foundations were established as baseline infrastructure capabilities.

## Security and Control Posture

- AAA scope and authorization boundaries are enforced according to current orchestrator policy.
- Telemetry and audit events are expected to remain structured, attributable, and export-ready.
- Integration interfaces are maintained as loosely coupled contracts to preserve VectorVue interoperability.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Environment consistency QA and baseline lint/test gates were defined and executed to lock in predictable setup behavior across contributors.

## Risk Register

Primary risk was configuration drift between developer hosts; mitigated through codified setup and shared container workflows.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 2 extends this baseline into orchestrator architecture implementation.
