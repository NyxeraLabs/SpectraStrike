# SpectraStrike Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-23

## 1. Policy Scope

This policy describes how data is handled in relation to SpectraStrike deployments.

It applies to:
- self-hosted customer deployments
- enterprise-managed environments
- future managed/SaaS service models (if offered)

## 2. Data Categories

### Identity and Account Data
- operator identity metadata
- role and authorization metadata
- session and authentication events

### Telemetry and Security Data
- task execution records
- scanner/integration outputs
- findings and evidence metadata
- operational logs and audit traces

### Technical Platform Metadata
- API access patterns
- infrastructure/service error logs
- service health and control-plane events

## 3. Processing Purpose

Data is processed to:
- execute authorized security validation workflows
- correlate and score security-relevant telemetry
- provide audit, reporting, and compliance evidence
- maintain platform reliability and abuse prevention

No data is sold for advertising purposes.

## 4. Deployment Responsibility Model

### Self-Hosted Mode
The customer organization is the data controller and retains infrastructure-level custody of platform data unless explicitly configured otherwise.

### Managed/SaaS Mode (Future)
Nyxera Labs may operate as processor/sub-processor under contractual controls and documented security safeguards.

## 5. Security Controls

SpectraStrike supports privacy-aligned security controls, including:
- TLS/mTLS transport protections
- role-based access controls
- auditability for security-relevant actions
- hardened runtime and governance checks

## 6. Retention and Deletion

Retention policies are deployment-configurable.
Customers are responsible for policy configuration and legal compliance in self-hosted mode.

## 7. Data Subject and Regulatory Requests

Requests regarding access, correction, deletion, or restriction should be submitted through customer governance channels or, where applicable, to Nyxera Labs support and privacy contacts.

## 8. International Transfer and Jurisdiction

Where data crosses jurisdictions, transfers must be governed by applicable legal mechanisms and enterprise agreements.

## 9. Policy Updates

This policy may be revised as architecture and service models evolve. Material changes should be recorded with revision date and governance approval.
